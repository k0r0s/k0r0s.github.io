### The disregard and fear of accelerationism 

Any search for _Accelerationism_ in the internet will surely go in the lines of Wikipedia's entry; which reflects nowadays' shift of the signified:

> Accelerationism is a range of revolutionary and reactionary ideas in left-wing and right-wing ideologies that call for the drastic intensification of capitalist growth, technological change, infrastructure sabotage and other processes of social change to destabilize existing systems and create radical social transformations, otherwise referred to as "acceleration".[^1][^2][^3][^4]

This definition bundles together left-wing and right-wing as if accelerationism were an apolitical method that both parties could use to meet their end goals.

However, there is a more insidious notion of accelerationism that the left often understands as the idea of accelerating the course of capitalism -in what aligns with right-wing market accelererationism- with the conviction that the inherent contradictions within the capitalist system will cause its collapse. This understanding has little to do with the stem planted in Deleuze and Guattari's works (_Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus_) and later followed by authors such as Fisher, Alex Williams and Nick Srnicek.

Their notion of acceleration was more about exploring the potentials within the flows of desire and the ways these could lead to new forms of life or new social configurations. The idea was not to push capitalism to a crisis point in order to overthrow it but to explore how the processes within capitalism might open up spaces for alternative ways of being. This is why their work resonates more with the idea of creating lines of flight—new directions or possibilities—rather than simply speeding up the existing trajectory of capitalism.

Why relying on accelerating said underlying contradictions of capitalism was proved wrong with the aftermath of the 2008's finantial crisis? Why didn't the crisis lead to the dismantling of the globalized neoliberal capitalist structure -although it might have lead to a partial debunking of the prosperous neoliberal narrative-?

The left's will to partake in discussions pertaining to accelerationism began to decline as the term's signified started to diverge away and was adopted by right-wing extremists such as neo-fascists, neo-Nazis, white nationalists and white supremacists to increasingly refer to an "acceleration" of racial conflict through assassinations, murders and terrorist attacks as a means to violently achieve a white ethnostate.[^5][^6] 

### The signified I defend.

The accelerationist philosophy I refer to, starts with the deleuzo-guattarian theory of deterritorialization. It aims to identify, deepen and radicalize the forces of deterritorialization with a view of overcoming the prevailing tendencies that suppress the possibility of far-reaching social transformation.

Paraphrasing Fisher: 
> Capitalism emerged as the necessary -but failed- escape from feudalism which instead of destroying encasement reconstitutes social stratification in the class structure. It is only given this model that Deleuze and Guattari's process to accelerate makes sense. It does not mean accelerating any-or-every-thing in capitalism haphazardly, in the hope that capitalism will thereby collapse; rather it means accelerating the processes of destratification that capitalism cannot but obstruct. 

Basically, it is the idea of actively strengthening (_from capital's view_) and exacerbating (_from the view of labour_) the development of capitalism, such as technological innovation and growth, in order to create an ever more radical society, for the conditions of **emancipatory change**.

Within the cycle of growth and search of profit of capitalism  -without ulterior motivation or end goal- relies the cause/driving force of deterritorialization. Striping values from a landscape (culture, labor, finance, human-relations) de-coding it, abstracting it and placing it (re-territorialization) in a new landscape that is more beneficial to capitalism; this new landscape comes generally with inherently nihilistic values, being devoid of the meaning of the original "territory".

Fisher elaborates how neoliberal capitalism has colonized our imagination, making it difficult to envision alternatives. He proposed the need to imagine and construct new futures beyond the constraints of the capitalist system—a theme that aligns with the idea of acceleration in the sense of creating new possibilities, but not necessarily through the intensification of capitalism itself.
