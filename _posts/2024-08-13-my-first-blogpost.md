### The disregard and fear of accelerationism 

Any search for _Accelerationism_ in the internet will surely go in the lines of Wikipedia's entry; which reflects nowadays' shift of the signified:

> Accelerationism is a range of revolutionary and reactionary ideas in left-wing and right-wing ideologies that call for the drastic intensification of capitalist growth, technological change, infrastructure sabotage and other processes of social change to destabilize existing systems and create radical social transformations, otherwise referred to as "acceleration".[^1][^2][^3][^4]

This definition bundles together left-wing and right-wing as if accelerationism were an apolitical method that all parties could use to meet their end goals. In 2019 Nick Land -the godfather of accelerationism, now a self declared reactionary with controversial right-wing views- tweeted: 
> "Accelerationism" means whatever the process makes it mean. 

Although it's a polysemous term it always implies political positioning. However, within the left accelerationist sphere, there is a more insidious notion of accelerationism that is often understood as the idea of accelerating the course of capitalism -in what aligns with right-wing market accelererationism- with the conviction that the inherent contradictions within the capitalist system will cause its collapse. This understanding falls short trying to interpret the stem planted in Deleuze and Guattari's works (_Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus_) and later followed by authors such as Fisher, Alex Williams and Nick Srnicek.

Their notion of acceleration was more about exploring the potentials within the _flows of desire_ (which are set free or roam on a greater scale with the introduction of money and free trade) and the ways these could lead to new forms of life or new social configurations. The idea was not to push capitalism to a crisis point in order to overthrow it but to explore how the processes within capitalism might open up spaces for alternative ways of being. This is why their work resonates more with the idea of creating lines of flight—new directions or possibilities—rather than simply speeding up the existing trajectory of capitalism.

_Why relying on accelerating said underlying contradictions of capitalism was proved wrong with the aftermath of the 2008's finantial crisis? Why didn't the crisis lead to the dismantling of the globalized neoliberal capitalist structure -although it might have lead to a partial debunking of the prosperous neoliberal narrative-?_

The crisis, while severe, did not lead to a wholesale rejection of capitalism by the public. Instead, the dominant narrative framed the crisis as a failure of specific institutions, policies, or regulatory lapses rather than an inherent flaw of the capitalist system itself. The United States, as the leading global power and a strong proponent of neoliberalism, player a key role in shaping the post-crisis response.

The 2008 financial crisis highlighted deep contradictions within the neoliberal capitalist system, but a combination of factors -including the entrenchment of neoliberalism, the absence of a coherent alternative, the resilience of capitalism, and global power dynamics— prevented a widespread shift towards socialism. While the crisis did lead to some questioning of neoliberal policies and a resurgence of interest in socialist ideas, particularly in the years that followed, these movements have faced significant obstacles in translating that interest into substantive political and economic change.

Although the general discourse around socialist measures was revitalized, there was a reticence to call accelerationism by its name, as the term's signified started to diverge away and was adopted by right-wing extremists such as neo-fascists, neo-Nazis, white nationalists and white supremacists to increasingly refer to an "acceleration" of racial conflict through assassinations, murders and terrorist attacks as a means to violently achieve a white ethnostate.[^5][^6] 

### The signified I defend.

The accelerationist philosophy I refer to, starts with the deleuzo-guattarian theory of deterritorialization. It aims to identify, deepen and radicalize the forces of deterritorialization with a view of overcoming the prevailing tendencies that suppress the possibility of far-reaching social transformation. 


We can see glances of this idea in Marx's speech for the _Free Trade Congress_[^9], as a sort of a proto-accelerationism, in the sense that he supported free trade because he understood that it would hasten the spread of ideas for a social revolution: 

> ... But, in general, the protective system of our day is conservative, while the free trade system is destructive. It breaks up old nationalities and pushes the antagonism of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to the extreme point. In a word, the free trade system hastens the social revolution. It is in this revolutionary sense alone, gentlemen, that I vote in favor of free trade.



It is a view on social transformation that is opposed to protectionism; -both economic and humanist protectionism-, that which would only the extend the capitalist processes over a longer period of time, resulting in a greater net negative.

Paraphrasing Mark Fisher: 

> Capitalism emerged as the necessary -but failed- escape from feudalism which instead of destroying encasement reconstitutes social stratification in the class structure. It is only given this model that Deleuze and Guattari's process to accelerate makes sense. It does not mean accelerating any-or-every-thing in capitalism haphazardly, in the hope that capitalism will thereby collapse; rather it means accelerating the processes of destratification that capitalism cannot but obstruct. 

Basically, it is the idea of actively strengthening (_from capital's view_) and exacerbating (_from the view of labour_) the development of capitalism, such as technological innovation and growth, in order to create an ever more radical society, for the conditions of ``emancipatory change``.

As Fisher viewed it, neoliberal capitalism has colonized our imagination, making it difficult to envision alternatives; and he proposed the need to imagine and construct new futures beyond the constraints of the capitalist system, aligning with the idea of acceleration in the sense of creating new possibilities, but not necessarily through the intensification of capitalism itself.

Within the cycle of growth and search of profit of capitalism -without ulterior motivation or end goal on itself- relies the cause/driving force for deterritorialization. Striping values from a landscape (culture, labor, finance, human-relations) de-coding it, abstracting it and placing it (re-territorialization) in a new landscape that is more beneficial to capitalism; this new landscape comes generally with inherently nihilistic values, being devoid of the meaning of the original "territory".
