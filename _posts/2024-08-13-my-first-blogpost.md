### Some definition

Contemporary accelerationist philosophy starts with the deleuzo-guattarian theory of deterritorialization. It aims to identify, deepen and radicalize the forces of deterritorialization with a view of overcoming the prevailing tendencies that suppress the possibility of far-reaching social transformation.

Paraphrasing Fisher: 
> Capitalism emerged as the necessary -but failed- escape from feudalism which instead of destroying encasement reconstitutes social stratification in the class structure. It is only given this model that Deleuze and Guattari's process to accelerate makes sense. It does not mean accelerating any-or-every-thing in capitalism haphazardly, in the hope that capitalism will thereby collapse; rather it means accelerating the processes of destratification that capitalism cannot but obstruct. 

Basically, it is the idea of actively strengthening (_from capital's view_) and exacerbating (_from the view of labour_) the development of capitalism, such as technological innovation and growth, in order to create an ever more radical society, for the conditions of **emancipatory change**.

Within the cycle of growth and search of profit of capitalism  -without ulterior motivation or end goal- relies the cause/driving force of deterritorialization. Striping values from a landscape (culture, labor, finance, human-relations) de-coding it, abstracting it and placing it (re-territorialization) in a new landscape that is more beneficial to capitalism; this new landscape comes generally with inherently nihilistic values, being devoid of the meaning of the original "territory".
